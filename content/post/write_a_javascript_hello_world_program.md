# Writing a JavaScript Hello World Program

JavaScript is a popular programming language used for web development, both on the client-side and server-side. If you are new to JavaScript and want to get started, a "Hello World" program is a great way to begin your journey. In this blog post, we will walk through the steps to write a JavaScript Hello World program and run it in a web browser.

## Writing the Code

To create a Hello World program in JavaScript, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred text editor or IDE and create a new file. Save it with a `.html` extension (e.g., `index.html`).

2. In the newly created file, enter the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <script>
      console.log("Hello, World!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- cpa -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-2843564932689995"
     data-ad-slot="3526097725"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

Let's break down the code:

- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: This line specifies the document type as HTML5.

- `<html>...</html>`: This block represents the HTML structure of the web page.

- `<head>...</head>`: This block contains metadata and the title of the web page.

- `<title>Hello World</title>`: This line sets the title of the web page to "Hello World".

- `<body>...</body>`: This block represents the body content of the web page.

- `<script>...</script>`: This block contains JavaScript code that will be executed in the browser.

- `console.log("Hello, World!");`: This line prints the text "Hello, World!" to the console. The `console.log` function is used to output messages to the browser's console.


## Summary
In this blog post, we explored the process of writing a JavaScript Hello World program and running it in a web browser. The Hello World program serves as a foundational starting point for learning JavaScript and allows you to familiarize yourself with the language's syntax and structure.

JavaScript is a versatile language that powers the interactivity and functionality of countless websites and web applications. With JavaScript, you can build dynamic user interfaces, manipulate data, handle events, and much more. Happy coding!
