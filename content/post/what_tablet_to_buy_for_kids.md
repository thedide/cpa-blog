# Choosing the Perfect Tablet for Young Kids: Why the iPad Stands Out

## Introduction:
Tablets have become indispensable tools in today's digital age, even for the youngest members of our society. With a plethora of options available, it can be overwhelming to select the right tablet for kids below school age. In this blog post, we will discuss the criteria to consider when picking a tablet for young children and explore why the iPad, particularly the Apple 9.7in iPad 6th generation from Early 2018, 32GB, is an excellent choice.

## Criteria for Selecting a Tablet for Kids Below School Age:

- Durability: Children can be quite rough with their belongings, so it's crucial to choose a tablet that can withstand accidental drops and rough handling.

- Parental Controls: Look for a tablet that offers robust parental control features. These controls allow parents to manage content, set time limits, and ensure a safe and age-appropriate digital environment for their children.

- Usability: The tablet should have an intuitive interface and easy-to-use features suitable for small hands. A child-friendly tablet should also provide a seamless user experience to prevent frustration.

Samsung Galaxy Tab A: A Good Choice
The Samsung Galaxy Tab A is a popular tablet that often comes up in discussions about tablets for kids. It offers a decent range of features and a child-friendly mode that restricts access to certain apps and content. However, when it comes to usability, the iPad outshines the competition.

Why the iPad is the Superior Choice:

- Intuitive Touch Buttons: The iPad's touch buttons are well-designed and responsive, making it easier and less frustrating for young kids to navigate. The seamless touch experience ensures smooth interactions, promoting a positive learning environment.

- Vast App Ecosystem: The iPad boasts a vast app ecosystem with a multitude of educational and entertainment options specifically designed for children. From interactive storybooks to educational games, the iPad offers a rich selection of engaging content for young learners.

- Robust Parental Controls: Apple's iOS provides robust parental control features, allowing parents to set content restrictions, manage screen time, and monitor usage. This ensures that children have a safe and controlled digital experience.

## Affordability: Refurbished or Used Older Generation iPads
While the latest iPad models can be pricey, there are cost-effective options available. One way to get an iPad for a good price is by considering refurbished or used older generation iPads. These devices are often perfectly fine for kids and offer a budget-friendly solution.
