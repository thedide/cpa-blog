# Discourse vs. Isso:

Commento and Isso are both self-hosted, free commenting systems that offer similar features such as moderation, spam filtering, and user authentication. However, there are some differences between the two:

- Commento is more focused on privacy and security. It offers features such as anonymous commenting and no tracking, which may be important for some users. Isso, on the other hand, does not have these privacy-focused features.

- Isso is written in Python, while Commento is written in Go. This may be important for users who prefer one programming language over the other or have experience working with one of the languages.

- Commento offers more customization options, including custom theming, custom domains, and custom URLs. Isso does not offer these customization options out of the box.

- Commento has a user-friendly interface that is easy to use and navigate. Isso has a more minimalistic interface that may be less intuitive for some users.

Overall, the choice between Commento and Isso will depend on the specific needs and preferences of the user. If privacy and customization are important factors, Commento may be the better choice. If simplicity and ease of use are more important, Isso may be the better choice.
