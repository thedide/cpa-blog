## What is My Ultimate Guide For Everything?

MUGE is a blog in which I introduce the products that I find useful for different purposes.

## Why did you create My Ultimate Guide For Everything?

For price comparison related content, I personally find product comparison overwhelming. For people that find their taste similar to mine, I wanted to create a framework in which instead of focusing on **product comparison** they can focus more on **price comparison** to save time and money. Behind the scene, I've done the research or tried different products through out the years and based on my taste and budget have come up with a shopping guide list in different categories. MUGE is where you can learn about my recommendations and find out where you can purchase them.

For informational content, hopefully the content I share with save you time by providing useful content about topics that are less broadly covered online.

## Disclaimer

Products introduced in this blog are only recommendations and it does not mean you should purchase them without doing your own research or using your logic :-)
