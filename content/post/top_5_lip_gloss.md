Fenty Beauty by Rihanna: Gloss Bomb Universal Lip Luminizer and Glossier: Lip Gloss are both popular lip gloss products, but they have some differences in terms of formula, finish, and price. Here are some of the main differences between the two:

Formula:

- Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb has a thick, cushiony texture that is formulated with shea butter and enriched with Vitamin E for a nourishing and hydrating effect on the lips.

- Glossier Lip Gloss has a lightweight, non-sticky formula that contains a blend of natural oils (including jojoba, castor, and coconut) to moisturize and soften the lips.

Finish:

- Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb has a high-shine, shimmery finish that is meant to enhance the natural color of the lips and give them a lustrous, plump look.

- Glossier Lip Gloss has a more subtle, glassy finish that adds a dewy, sheer layer of shine to the lips without being overly glossy or glittery.

Shade range:

Price:

- Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb retails for around $19 USD for a 0.3 oz tube.

- Glossier Lip Gloss retails for around $14 USD for a 0.14 oz tube.

Overall, both Fenty Beauty Gloss Bomb and Glossier Lip Gloss are great options for achieving a shiny, hydrated look on the lips, but they have different formulas, finishes, and price points to consider.
