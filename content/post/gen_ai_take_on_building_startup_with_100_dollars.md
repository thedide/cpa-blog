# How to build the startup?

Building a startup with only $100 may seem like a daunting task, but it's not impossible. Here are some steps you can take:

1- Start with an idea: Think of a problem that you can solve with a product or service. It's best to choose something you're passionate about, as this will help keep you motivated.

2- Validate your idea: Before investing any money, make sure your idea is viable by conducting market research. This can be done by talking to potential customers, researching online, and analyzing the competition.

3- Build a prototype: Once you've validated your idea, create a prototype of your product or service. This can be a simple website, app, or physical product that you can test with potential customers.

4- Leverage free tools: There are plenty of free tools available that can help you build and market your startup. Use platforms like social media, free website builders, and email marketing services to reach your target audience.

5- Start small: Don't try to do everything at once. Focus on a niche market and gradually expand your reach as your startup grows.

6- Bootstrap your business: Use your own funds, resources, and skills to build your startup. This will help you save money on expenses like office space, equipment, and marketing.

7- Network: Attend industry events, join online communities, and network with other entrepreneurs. This will help you gain valuable insights, advice, and potential customers.

Remember, building a successful startup takes time and effort. With patience, persistence, and a solid plan, you can turn your $100 investment into a thriving business.

# How to choose your target domain?

Choosing the right market for your startup is crucial for its success. Here are some tips to consider when choosing a market:

1- Identify a problem: Choose a market that has a problem that you can solve. This could be a pain point or a gap in the market that you can fill with your product or service.

2- Target a niche: Don't try to target everyone. Instead, focus on a specific niche market that you can serve better than anyone else. This will help you differentiate yourself from the competition.

3- Research your competition: Analyze your competition to see what they are doing well and where they are falling short. This will help you identify opportunities and gaps in the market.

4- Consider your passion and skills: Choose a market that aligns with your passion and skills. This will help you stay motivated and committed to your startup.

5- Evaluate market size: Evaluate the size of the market you're considering. Is it large enough to support your startup and provide growth opportunities?

6- Look for emerging trends: Consider emerging trends and technologies that can impact the market you're targeting. This will help you stay ahead of the curve and provide innovative solutions.

Remember, choosing the right market for your startup is crucial, as it will determine your customer base, revenue potential, and growth opportunities. Take the time to research and analyze your options to make an informed decision.
