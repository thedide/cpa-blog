Comfort: Air conditioning helps to maintain a comfortable indoor environment by regulating the temperature and humidity levels. This is especially important during hot and humid weather when high temperatures can be uncomfortable and even dangerous.
 Health: Air conditioning can help to improve indoor air quality by filtering out pollutants, allergens, and other harmful particles. This is especially important for people with respiratory issues, allergies, or asthma.</description>
