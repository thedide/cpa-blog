## What is My Ultimate Shopping Guide?

MUSG is a blog in which I introduce the products that I find useful for different purposes.

## Why did you create My Ultimate Shopping Guide?

I personally find product comparison overwhelming. For people that find their taste similar to mine, I wanted to create a framework in which instead of focusing on **product comparison** they can focus more on **price comparison** to save time and money. Behind the scene, I've done the research or tried different products through out the years and based on my taste and budget have come up with a shopping guide list in different categories. MUSG is where you can learn about my recommendations and find out where you can purchase them.

## Disclaimer

Products introduced in this blog are only recommendations and it does not mean you should purchase them without doing your own research or using your logic :-)
