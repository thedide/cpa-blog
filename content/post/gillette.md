## Gillette Pure Shave Cream

I used Gillette pure shave cream, and I have to be honest I'm at a loss. What a wonderful mix! The leather in the shaving cream is very light, but very stiff, which makes it really easy to shave, and the extra moisturizing properties make the cream feel like a dream. I didn't expect the extra moisturizing properties because I never even thought of adding that to my shaving routine. I find that this formula has the most benefits for my dry skin type, and I actually prefer it over other Shave Balm. I want to use this like a thick soap as I don't even need to lather it, because it has a nice feel when you apply and it sinks into your skin so well.

I personally like gillette products because I've gone out of my way to find out all the ins and outs of the products they use. I hope my friends are able to find the same results that I do for a minimal outlay of time. PURE is infused with aloe  to help keep your skin beautiful, hydrated and feeling soft.
Help protect against irritation during the shave and prevent razor burns and cuts. Try it, a great alternative to your usual foaming shave cream. It makes your razor glide even smoother. This cream will really allow you to enjoy a great shave when you use it - while still helping to prevent razor burn and razor cuts.
