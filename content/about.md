One of the remarkable aspects of human existence is the shared nature of our experiences and challenges. While each individual's circumstances may differ, it is often the case that the problems we encounter have been previously faced by others. Recognizing this universal truth opens up a world of possibilities for mutual support and growth. By documenting our personal journeys, sharing our struggles, and offering solutions, we can create a treasure trove of knowledge and wisdom. When we make these experiences available to others, they can find solace in knowing they are not alone and gain valuable insights and practical advice. This exchange of information allows individuals to save time by learning from others' trials and errors, finding comfort in the fact that someone has already navigated a similar path. Ultimately, by sharing our stories and solutions, we can foster a sense of community, inspire positive change, and help others feel better equipped to face the challenges that life presents.

## What is My Ultimate Guide For Everything?

MUGE is a blog in which we write about our own experiences and make them available for others. We write about a wide range of topics from tech to fashion and toys. 

## Why did we create My Ultimate Guide For Everything?

Initially we created MUGE For price comparison across multiple websites to empower consumers to make more informed decision since we  personally found product comparison overwhelming. Later, we started covering a wider range of topics with the goal of sharing the solutions we find for our problems with others to inspire them and save them time. Our philosophy is summarized in the first paragraph of this page. In a nutshell, as human beings we are constantly solving problems which takes us time and sometimes require trial and error. Most of the times we don't bother thinking about how we solve these problems or ducomenting them. We believe being more congnizant of the problems we solve and taking a moment to document and share them can help ourselves and others to navigate the world better.
