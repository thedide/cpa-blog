# Writing a Scala Hello World Program

Scala is a powerful programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It combines object-oriented programming and functional programming concepts, making it a versatile choice for various applications. In this blog post, we will walk through the steps to write a Scala Hello World program and run it on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Before we dive into writing code, ensure that you have the following:

- **Scala Installation:** Make sure you have Scala installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Scala from the official website (https://www.scala-lang.org/download/).

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Scala runs on the JVM, so you need to have a JDK installed. Ensure that you have JDK 8 or later installed.

- **Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Choose a text editor or IDE of your preference, such as IntelliJ IDEA, Visual Studio Code, or Sublime Text.

## Writing the Code

To create a Hello World program in Scala, follow these steps:

1. Open your preferred text editor or IDE and create a new file. Save it with a `.scala` extension (e.g., `HelloWorld.scala`).

2. In the newly created file, enter the following code:

```scala
object HelloWorld {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello, World!")
  }
}
```

<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
<!-- cpa -->
<ins class="adsbygoogle"
     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-2843564932689995"
     data-ad-slot="3526097725"
     data-ad-format="auto"
     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
<script>
     (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script>

The code above defines an object named HelloWorld with a main method. Inside the main method, we use the println function to output the text "Hello, World!" to the console.

## Running the Program

Once you have written the code, it's time to run it on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Save the file.

2. Open the terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where you saved the Scala file using the `cd` command.

4. Compile the program by typing `scalac HelloWorld.scala` and pressing Enter. This will generate a bytecode file with the `.class` extension.

5. Run the program by typing `scala HelloWorld` and pressing Enter.

6. The output should be displayed in the terminal:


```
Hello, World!
```

Congratulations! You have successfully written and executed your first Scala Hello World program.

## Summary
In this blog post, we explored the process of writing a Scala Hello World program. We discussed the necessary prerequisites, wrote a simple code snippet using the println function, and executed the program on your machine.

Scala is a powerful language that combines the best of object-oriented and functional programming paradigms. It offers features such as immutability, pattern matching, and higher-order functions, making it an excellent choice for building scalable and robust applications.

Now that you have successfully run your first Scala program, you can continue your learning journey and explore the wide range of possibilities that Scala offers.
