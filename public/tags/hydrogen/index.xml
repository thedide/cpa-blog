      <description>What is a Hydrogen Combustion Engine? A hydrogen combustion engine is a type of internal combustion engine that uses hydrogen as its primary fuel source.

Hydrogen combustion engines work by mixing hydrogen gas with air inside a combustion chamber. The resulting mixture is then ignited, causing the hydrogen to combust and release energy in the form of heat.</description>
