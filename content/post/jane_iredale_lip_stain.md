### How to choose the color?
**Choosing the Right Lip Stain Color**

*Consider Your Skin Undertone:*
- **Cool Undertone:** If you have cool undertones (your veins appear bluish, and you look better in silver jewelry), opt for lip stains with blue or purple undertones. Shades like berry, plum, cool pinks, and mauve tend to work well.
- **Warm Undertone:** If you have warm undertones (your veins appear greenish, and you look better in gold jewelry), go for lip stains with warm undertones like coral, peach, warm reds, and terracotta.

*Age and Skin Tone:*
- As you age, it's generally a good idea to choose lip colors that are more neutral or flattering to your skin tone. Avoid extremely bold or neon shades, which can sometimes be less flattering as you get older.
- **Fair Skin:** Light pinks, soft corals, and sheer reds can work well for fair skin tones.
- **Medium Skin:** A wide range of colors, including rose, berry, and medium reds, can complement medium skin tones.
- **Dark Skin:** Deep plums, rich reds, and dark berries often look stunning on dark skin.

*Occasion and Personal Style:*
- Consider the occasion and your personal style. For everyday wear, you might prefer more neutral, subtle shades, while you can experiment with bolder colors for special events.

*Test Before Buying:*
- Always try lip stain shades before purchasing them, either by swatching on your wrist or applying a small amount on your lips. Lighting in stores can be deceiving, so natural light is the best.

*Lip Shape:*
- The shape of your lips can also affect how a lip stain looks on you. If you have thin lips, you may want to avoid very dark shades, as they can make your lips appear even thinner.

*Undertones in Lip Stains:*
- Some lip stains have different undertones (cool, warm, neutral). Be aware of the undertones in the product, as they can significantly impact how a color looks on your lips.

*Consider Your Outfit:*
- Your lip color should complement your outfit. For example, if you're wearing warm-toned clothing, choose a lip stain with warm undertones.

Remember, makeup is about personal expression, and there are no hard and fast rules. These guidelines can help you find lip stain shades that enhance your natural beauty, but ultimately, choose colors that make you feel confident and comfortable. Experimentation can also be a fun way to discover what works best for you.
